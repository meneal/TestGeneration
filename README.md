##Test Generation Homework

I had to add spaces to the coverage summary to get it to display close to correctly,
there is a screenshot in the img folder just in case whoever's reading this wants to see it:

=============================== Coverage summary ===============================

Statements   : 100% ( 58/58 )

Branches     : 100% ( 16/16 )

Functions    : 100% ( 5/5 )

Lines        : 100% ( 57/57 )

================================================================================
